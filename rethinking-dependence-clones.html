<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p><em>Semantic code clones</em> are regions of duplicated code that may appear dissimilar
but compute similar functions. Since in general it is algorithmically
undecidable whether two or more programs compute the same function, locating all
semantic code clones is infeasible. One way to dodge the undecidability issue
and find potential semantic clones, using only static information, is to search
for recurring subgraphs of a <em>program dependence graph</em> (PDG).  PDGs represent
control and data dependence relationships between statements or operations in a
program.  PDG-based clone detection techniques, unlike syntactically-based
techniques, do not distinguish between code fragments that differ only because
of dependence-preserving statement re-orderings, which also preserve semantics.
Consequently, they detect clones that are difficult to find by other means.
Despite this very desirable property, work on PDG-based clone detection has
largely stalled, apparently because of concerns about the scalability of the
approach.  We argue, however, that the time has come to reconsider PDG-based
clone detection, as a part of a holistic strategy for clone management.  We
present evidence that its scalability problems are not as severe as previously
thought.  This suggests the possibility of developing integrated clone
management systems that fuse information from multiple clone detection methods,
including PDG-based ones.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Fragments of similar code are typically scattered throughout large code bases.
These repeated fragments or <em>code clones</em> often result from programmers copying
and pasting code.  Code clones (or just <em>clones</em>) may also result from
limitations of a programming language, use of certain APIs or design patterns,
following coding conventions, or a variety of other causes.  Whatever their
causes, existing clones need to be managed. When a programmer modifies a region
of code that is cloned in another location in the program, they should make an
active decision whether or not to modify the other location.  Clearly, such
decisions can only be made if the programmer is aware of the other location.</p>
<p>In general, there are 4 types of code clones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type-1 Clones -</strong> Identical regions of code (excepting whitespace and
  comments).</li>
<li><strong>Type-2 Clones -</strong> Syntactically equivalent regions (excepting names,
  literals, types, and comments).</li>
<li><strong>Type-3 Clones -</strong> Syntactically similar regions (as in Type-2) but with
  minor differences such as statement additions or deletions.</li>
<li><strong>Type-4 Clones -</strong> Regions of code with functionally equivalent behavior but
  possibly with different syntactic structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of the research on code clone detection and maintenance has been geared
toward Type-1 and Type-2 clone, as they are easier to detect and validate than
Type-3 and Type-4 clones.  The two most popular detection methods involve
searching for clones in <em>token streams</em> and <em>abstract syntax trees</em> (ASTs).</p>
<p>An alternative approach to clone detection is to search for them in a <em>Program
Dependence Graph</em> (PDG), which represents the control and data dependences
between statements or operations in a program.  Recurring subgraphs in PDGs
represent potential <em>dependence clones</em>.  Some of the previous work on PDG-based
clone detection used forward and backward path-slicing to find clones.  This
method can detect matching slices, but it cannot detect all recurring subgraphs.
The latter can be identified using <em>frequent subgraph mining</em> (FSM).  However,
for low frequency thresholds, the number of PDG subgraphs discovered by FSM may
be enormous.  For example, we found that for a Java program with 70,000 lines of
code (LOC), over 700 million PDG subgraphs with 5 or more instances were
discovered by FSM.</p>
<p>Since it is infeasible for developers to examine so many subgraphs, we
previously developed <a href="http://hackthology.com/sampling-code-clones-from-program-dependence-graphs-with-graple.html">GRAPLE</a>, an algorithm to
select representative samples of maximal frequent subgraphs.  In this paper, the
core sampling process remains the same as in GRAPLE but we present a new
algorithm for traversing the <em>k</em>-frequent subgraph lattice.  One tricky aspect
of FSM is how to define exactly what "frequency" means in a large connected
graph. In order to handle pathological cases that occur in real programs, we
introduce a new metric to measure subgraph frequency (or "support"), called
the <em>Greedy Independent Subgraphs</em> (GIS) measure.  The results section details
the first empirical examination of the scalability and speed of sampling
dependence clones from large programs. The study showed that our new system can
quickly sample from programs with 500 KLOC of code and successfully sample from
programs with perhaps 2 MLOC. Finally, since at times the sampling algorithm may
return several potential clones, which are quite similar to each other, we
evaluate the performance of a density-based clustering algorithm on the samples
collected.</p>
